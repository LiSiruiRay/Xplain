This is a platform to accelerate self-learning process, powering by LLMs.

# Functions

- Answer Questions: our platform can be used as a personal tutor. While having any questions about the video, pause and ask. Our bot will answer it for you, with simple language, outside resources, reference of this specific course (along which part of the video you should rewatch and what part of the text you should check out)
- Summarization: For the long videos (particularly for those without sections), we will use a clustering algorithm along with LLMs to generate a summarization and sections for the video.
- Pop up quiz: We will use our bot, fed with quiz and assignment from course website, to generate a series pop up quiz while you watching the video. This will first make sure that u r paying attention on the video and second that u are understanding the content
- Personalized active learning helper: We will also implement a function that allows you to select your current level of knowledge, vocabulary, and ability to understand language. By doing so, we allowed the bot to actively pop up tips and explanation of video content

# Documentations

We will use React as front end and Flask as back end. For now we will use ChatGPT as our AI engine.
